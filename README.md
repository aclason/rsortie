### Modelling forest stand dynamics with SORTIE-ND in R

This is an R package that allows users to interact with SORTIE-ND. Specifically, users can modify input parameter files, run simulations, and process output files from SORTIE-ND.

We assume that users are familiar with R (http://www.cran.r-project.org/), and have downloaded are familiar with SORTIE-ND (http://www.sortie-nd.org/).

### Installation

1.\ Install the SORTIE-ND GUI.  

Go to http://www.sortie-nd.org/software/index.html and download the newest version.

2.\ Set the value of the JAVA-HOME environment variable (Optional)  

In some cases, the SORTIE GUI does not know where to locate Java even though it is installed on the userâ€™s system. To fix this issue on a Windows 10 computer:

Search for **Environment Variables** and select **Edit the system Environment Variables**.  
Click **Environment Variables** near the bottom right.  
Under **System Variables**, click **New**.  
Set the *Variable Name* as **JAVA_HOME**.  
Set the *Variable Value* as the `C:\filepath\location\of\java.exe`  
Click OK and close the Environment Variables editor.  

Or

Open **Command Prompt** (Run as administrator).  
Run:  
```r 
setx -m JAVA_HOME "C:\filepath\location\of\java.exe"
```
Verify the Environment Variable has been added correctly by restarting Command Prompt and running:  
```r
echo %JAVA_HOME%
```
You should see the file path location of java.exe  


3.\ Install `rsortie` from github.

```r
#install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aclason/rsortie")
```
